# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms, allowing users to understand their step-by-step operation through interactive animations. The tool dynamically generates arrays of user-defined sizes and visualizes sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Users can specify the size of the array to visualize.
- **Sorting Algorithms Visualized**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
- **Color-Coded Visualization**: Array elements are displayed with random colors for better distinction.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience.
